  "body": "#LoggedFS - Filesystem monitoring with Fuse\r\n##Description\r\n\r\nLoggedFS is a fuse-based filesystem which can log every operations that happens in it. \r\n\r\nHow does it work ?\r\n\r\nFuse does almost everything. LoggedFS only sends a message to syslog when called by fuse and then let the real filesystem do the rest of the job.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\nIf loggedfs is included in your distribution you can just install with your package manager.\r\n\r\n##Installation from source\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst you have to make sure that fuse is installed on your computer. \r\nIf you have a recent distribution it should be. Fuse can be downloaded here : https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse.\r\nThen you should download the loggedfs archive and install it with the make command :\r\n\r\n    tar xfj loggedfs-X.Y.tar.bz2\r\n    cd loggedfs-X.Y\r\n    make\r\n    make install\r\n    \r\nLoggedFS has the following dependencies :\r\n\r\n    fuse\r\n    rlog\r\n    pcre\r\n    libxml2\r\n\r\n##Configuration\r\n\r\nLoggedFS can use an XML configuration file if you want it to log operations only for certain files, for certain users, or for certain operations.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample configuration file :\r\n\r\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n    \r\n    <loggedFS logEnabled=\"true\" printProcessName=\"true\">\r\n      <includes>\r\n        <include extension=\".*\" uid=\"*\" action=\".*\" retname=\".*\"/>\r\n      </includes>\r\n      <excludes>\r\n        <exclude extension=\".*\\.bak$\" uid=\"*\" action=\".*\" retname=\"SUCCESS\"/>\r\n        <exclude extension=\".*\" uid=\"1000\" action=\".*\" retname=\"FAILURE\"/>\r\n        <exclude extension=\".*\" uid=\"*\" action=\"getattr\" retname=\".*\"/>\r\n      </excludes>\r\n    </loggedFS>\r\n\r\nThis configuration can be used to log everything except it if concerns a *.bak file, or if the uid is 1000, or if the operation is getattr.\r\n\r\n##Launching LoggedFS\r\n\r\nIf you just want to test LoggedFS you don't need any configuration file.\r\n \r\nJust use that command :\r\n\r\n    loggedfs -f -p /var\r\n\r\nYou should see logs like these :\r\n\r\n    tail -f /var/log/syslog\r\n    17:29:34 (src/loggedfs.cpp:552) LoggedFS running as a public filesystem\r\n    17:29:34 (src/loggedfs.cpp:547) LoggedFS not running as a daemon\r\n    17:29:34 (src/loggedfs.cpp:666) LoggedFS starting at /var.\r\n    17:29:34 (src/loggedfs.cpp:691) chdir to /var\r\n    17:29:35 (src/loggedfs.cpp:136) getattr /var/ {SUCCESS} [ pid = 8700 kded [kdeinit] uid = 1000 ]\r\n    17:29:41 (src/loggedfs.cpp:136) getattr /var/ {SUCCESS} [ pid = 10923 ls uid = 1000 ]\r\n    17:29:41 (src/loggedfs.cpp:136) getattr /var/run {SUCCESS} [ pid = 10923 ls uid = 1000 ]\r\n    17:29:41 (src/loggedfs.cpp:136) getattr /var/run/nscd {FAILURE} [ pid = 10923 ls uid = 1000 ]\r\n    17:29:41 (src/loggedfs.cpp:136) readdir /var/ {SUCCESS} [ pid = 10923 ls uid = 1000 ]\r\n    17:29:41 (src/loggedfs.cpp:136) getattr /var/pouak {SUCCESS} [ pid = 10923 ls uid = 1000 ]\r\n\r\nIf you have a configuration file to use you should use this command :\r\n\r\n    ./loggedfs -c loggedfs.xml -p /var\r\n\r\nIf you want to log what other users do on your filesystem, you should use the -p option to allow them to see your mounted files.
